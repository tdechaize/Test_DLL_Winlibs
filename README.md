# Test_DLL_Winlibs
Generate DLL and test (multiples tests) 

Initials objectives : code and test DLL in which entry point is used, multiple functions defined, and call of these functions are "natural" : only by the name of function (with not decorations : "_" before or after, or "@nn" in suffix of the name of function).

Results : all tests DLL are good with two compilers included : CLANG and GCC/MINGW. 
Cherry on cake : command file to generate DLL are very similar syntax.
